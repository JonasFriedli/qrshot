# qrshot
qrshot is a lightweight Linux tool that lets you screenshot a region, decode any QR codes inside, and copy the result directly to your clipboard. It builds on proven open-source utilities like grim/slurp or maim/scrot for screenshots, zbarimg for decoding, and wl-clipboard/xclip for clipboard support.
